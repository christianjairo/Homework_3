<h1>Homework 3</h1>
<h2>1. Finish this challenge statement: For the final project I will design a website that will ____________</h2>
<p>For the final project I will design a website that will showcase my creative work</p>
<h2>2. Define 3 "types" of people that might want to visit your site (ex: music producers looking for talent, teen looking for new music, Sirius radio DJ)</h2>
<p>Fellow artists might want to visit my site. Why? Because artists are all over Instagram and other social media applications. The applications give artists exposure and can help them find new audiences or a job. By going on my site, they can go through my creative work and reach out to me if they would like to collaborate on a piece of work together. Collaborating with another artist is a win-win for both artists and by seeing my artwork, it gives them the opportunity to do so with me.</p>
<p>Someone looking to hire a graphic designer might want to look at my site. I have several projects I've done and show my experience.</p>
<p>Someone looking to hire a photographer might want to look at my site to review my photography skills. Specifically, I do a lot of portrait photography and my site will show that.</p>
<h2>3. Find three sites that reflect what you'd like to aspire to or emulate.</h2>
<p>I like Vaynermedia's site because it has a nice layout and that is what I would like to take from it.</p>
<p>I like World of Swiss' site because of how interactive it is.</p>
<p>I lke Minimums' website because of it's grid structure and perhaps that is something I would like in my site as well</p>
